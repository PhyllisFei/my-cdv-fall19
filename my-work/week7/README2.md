### Dataset 1: [World Happiness Report](https://www.kaggle.com/unsdsn/world-happiness)

This dataset ranks representatives from 158 countries in 2015, 157 countries in 2016, 155 countries in 2017, by their happiness levels. Participants were asked to evaluate their current lives based on factors including economic production, social support, life expectancy, freedom, absence of corruption, and generosity.

One possible way to build a data story out of this dataset: compare happiness levels among all countries, then group countries according to continents and compare again, then maybe rank factors that influence people's happiness from the most to the least.

### Dataset 2: [Weibo Data about Online Praying via Reposting to the "Koi Fish"](https://opendata.pku.edu.cn/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.18170/DVN/KKGAYB)

This dataset contain Weibo reposting data about the online praying to the Koi Fish, along with the information about the reposters (name, gender, number of followers, number of people they follow, reposting text contents, etc.). The data coverage is from 08/2017 to 01/2018, collected from monthly praying posts.

My potential approach to visualize it as a data story: correlate the repost behavior with gender as well as visualizing the density of reposting behavior according to months (don't know if this correlation will make any sense yet, need more time to think about).

### Dataset3: [Data Collection from 0.1 million+ Zhihu Users](https://opendata.pku.edu.cn/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.18170/DVN/XLRXFR)

This dataset collected profile information from over 0.1 million Zhihu users. Their information includes gender, location, job, number of followers, number of people they follow, number of questions they have answered, numbers of posts they have favorited, number of articles they have posted, and so on.

I imagine a potential data story of this dataset to be: the distribution and density of users's locations, and the correlation between users locations and their activeness (number of questions they have answered, numbers of posts they have favorited) (may be need more time to think about it, or can also be about the correlation between numbers of followers and number of questions they have answered).
