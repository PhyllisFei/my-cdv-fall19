Q: Why does Bowker say "'Raw data is both and oxymoron and a bad idea'" ? (pp. 663)
A: Raw data is meaningless unless we utilize it within a certain context or condition, depending on what we want to research about or figure out. To understand data, we need to know where it comes from, imagine and correlate it with something else, through which we give it our own interpretation. Without this interpretation process, it is just an object that stands for nothing.

Q: What could be meant by the quote "'accounting tools [...] do not simply aid the measurement of economic activity, they shape the reality they measure'"? Try draw parallels to the CompStat system from the Reply All Podcast.
A: Accounting tools are built upon data which is collected from what researchers consider to be useful and necessary. Once database as such is built, people tend to rely on it, believe it to be authoritative and the "standard" for people to refer to. As is mentioned in the Podcast, "I know it’s not fair, but I have to do what CompStat says. Because if I don’t, they’ll just punish me." The CompStat system draws policemen's focus from keeping a place safe to blindly reducing the crime rate. The provided instructions and knowledge from the database in fact constrain and even control people how to deal with certain conditions. Those tools then restrict people from thinking critically and dependently, while leading them to a narrowed result that is framed within its own context. Results like these cannot be the reality but certain sides the tool wants people to see, through which the reality is shaped.

Q: In which way is Twitter data limited?
A: First, “twitter users” is not synonymous with “people” because not everyone is using Twitter and one user may have multiple accounts sharing different opinions. Second, some data is skewed depending on what the researcher seeks for. Third, the source of tweets is uncertain, so it’s hard to understand them. Fourth, some publicly accessible tweets are missing from the firehose but only few people have access. All these make Twitter data limited.

Q: If you don't need to login to obtain certain data, then it is public and free to use. Or isn't it? Please share your opinion.
A: I disagree. Some data may be de-anonymized since they are collected without requesting permission from people, which goes against protecting participants’ privacy. “Public” means visible, but is not equal to “ok to use.” We seek for data that fits our idea, so the way we use it may be out of the author’s context, and thus the “opinion” the selected data presents may be completely different from its original context. Then, data becomes unreliable.
