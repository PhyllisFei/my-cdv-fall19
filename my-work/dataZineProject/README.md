## Feeling Happy Today?
> Data Zine Project by Phyllis Fei

Data I collected for this project is: how many times I laugh every 2 hour (from 8am to 8pm) in 2 weeks (from Sep 10th to 23rd), and who cause my laughter.

**I used 2 graphs for data visualization.**
- The first one is a matrix graph (I would like to call it so) which visualizes _who_ cause my laughter for _how many times_ on _each day_. It also roughly shows how many times I laugh a day in total, and on which day I laugh the most/least.
- The second one is an area graph which shows how each cause of my laughter _changes over time_, as well as the _cumulated totals_ of my laughter on each day. It also shows on which day at what specific time I laugh the most/least.

2. Challenges
   - Since the data I collected has many detailed information, it was messy and hard for me to get them well organized and ready to use. It was cleaned up the first time by taking out the features I need and putting into a new array. The second time was done by combining "date" and "time" to form new a date object. Thanks Leon for helping me clean my data twice :)
   - I spent much time understanding how area graph works. My data got nested and then stacked before use, which still needs to be spent more time on and understood.

3. Reflection
   - I hardcoded the position of each matrix box in the first graph... I guess it can be done by for-loop to make it easier next time.
   - The visual depends on features of my data set. The area graph is not as beautiful as I imagine, so I picked a better color combination to make it look nicer at least...
   - I would like to learn more about how to collect data more wisely so that I'll have a beautiful data set next time.
