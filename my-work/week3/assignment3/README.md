Data I use here is "how many times I laugh in every 2 hrs."

Laughter is categorized into five causes (people who made me laugh): family, friends, professors, strangers and alone.

Each block stands for data from the same day ï¼ˆRow 1 is for data from week 1, row 2 is for week 2, in date sequence).

I wasn't able to get data from according to the cause factor at first. Leon helped me do a data cleanup which I very much appreciate!!
