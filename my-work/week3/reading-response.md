## The Minority Report
> 3 contemporary applications in which data is used to predict the future and we then act upon

**App 1: Spotify**
Spotify collects data from users' search history and songs users frequently listen to, categorizes them, and then provides new recommendation for people. It predicts users' favorite types of songs for future listening experience. Since Spotify's recommendation fits people's taste most of the time, people usually click on the songs and listen to them.

**App 2: Dazhongdianping**
Dazhongdianping is pretty much like TripAdvisor which provides food, places to visit, and other entertainment activities for people. It analyzes data from your search history and recommends food types that matches your taste. People are able to add restaurants they like or plan to go in the future to a list, Dazhongdianping then uses these data to remind users of those places. For example, when you are searching for noodles and you've had some noodle places on the list, it will filter them out to the top for your reference. People respond by checking those places out.

**App 3: Clock from Apple**
If you keep turning on an alarm before sleep, Clock then predicts your repetitive action at the approximate time you go to bed and suggests you doing it. For me, I always follow its prediction to turn the alarm back on for the next day.
