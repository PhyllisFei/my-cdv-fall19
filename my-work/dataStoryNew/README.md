## Welcome to the Era-of-Milk-tea
> This is a data story that offers some broad information about milk tea culture in China, as well as some facts about sugar and caffeine contents in milk tea (in selected beverages).

> Dataset used in this project credits to Shanghai Customers Council. Background information credits to iiMedia Research and Meituan.

**This is what first appears in this project to show some background information.**

**Users click on regular sugar/no sugar option to see how much sugar is added in one serving and compare what merchants mean by "regular" and "no" sugar.**

- Process
  I originally wanted to visualize obesity in China, and did found reliable, official data resources online. However, as I work with the dataset, I feel constrained in terms of how to make such a broad topic more creative, offering something interesting or new to my audience. I also felt that the dataset itself is not rich in information. So I switched my idea to work with milk tea data.

- Compromises
  - The dataset is built in 2017. I believe many brands have made adjustments to their beverages, so the current data visualization can only serve as a reference for the situation in 2017. It cannot really represent how the milk tea industry is in the current 2019 situation.
