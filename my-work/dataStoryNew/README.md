## Welcome to the Era-of-Milk-tea
> This is a data story that offers some broad information about milk tea culture in China, as well as some facts about sugar and caffeine contents in milk tea (in selected beverages).
> Dataset used in this project credits to Shanghai Customers Council. Background information credits to iiMedia Research and Meituan.


- **Demo**

  - This is what first appears in this project to show some background information.

  - Users click on regular sugar/no sugar option to see how much sugar is added in one serving and compare what merchants mean by "regular" and "no" sugar. </br>

  - Here I visualize the correlation of caffeine in milk tea with that in Americano and Redbull.**

- **Process**
  - I originally wanted to visualize "obesity in China," and did find reliable, official data resources online. However, since the dataset itself is not rich in information, I feel constrained in terms of how to make such a broad topic more creative, offering something interesting or new to my audience.
  - Thinking of my friends being confused about why they feel so awake after having milk tea, as well as the increasing number of them choosing no-sugar option (because they think it's sugar-free), I switched my idea to work with milk tea data.
  - I calculated the correlation 1)between sugar in milk tea and sugar in cube sugar, 2)between caffeine in milk tea and caffeine in large Americano, 3)between caffeine in milk tea and caffeine in Redbull. I also researched about recommended sugar and caffeine daily intake for adults according to The Dietary Guidelines for Chinese Residents, and compare it with sugar and caffeine content in milk tea.

- **Compromises**
  - The dataset is built in 2017. I believe many brands have made adjustments to their beverages, so the current data visualization can only serve as a reference for the situation in 2017. It cannot really represent how the milk tea industry is in the current 2019 situation. Since this subject area is quite specific, related data is quite limited and not accessible.
  - The calculated number are not integers, so I am not able to visualize 1/2 or 2/5 part of the svg.

- **Self-evaluation**
  - If I have more time, I would like to draw more images to represent conditions where 1/2, 2/5 etc. cup of Americano/Redbull/Cube sugar appear in the calculation.
  - If more recent data is accessible, I would like to build one for the current (2019) situation.
  - I think my way of using concrete objects to visualize numbers is effective and intuitive.
