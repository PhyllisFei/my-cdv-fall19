> Our thirst for data, like our thirst for oil, is historically imperialist and colonialist, and tightly tied to capitalist networks of exploitation (246).

James Bridle brings up data as an analogy with oil and throws it into the capitalism society. It reminds me of Shoshana Zuboff's book _The Age of Surveillance Capitalism_ where she argues that data has been traded as products for capitalists to make profits. I've never thought that our data has been such abundant resource which is just like oil, driving a huge commercial market. What I feel so afraid of is that now that we've had so much personal data exposed to the public, yet there is so little we know, about how (well or bad) and where it's been used.

> It enforces computational thinking upon us, driving the deep divisions in society caused by misbegotten classification, fundamentalism and populism, and accelerating inequality (247).

As Bridle mentions, "... must data be broken down, analyzed for it to have value." I think the selection/breakdown/analysis process of data is where makes data not only valuable and useful, but bias -- whoever is analyzing the data, he starts with a purpose, or, even a potential conclusion that he wants to prove through data analysis. After data is analyzed and published, it is capable of creating a direction for people to either follow or query. Starts from here, we see opinions/trends flowing to different directions, and effecting larger parts in the society.

> But what we should be seeing is the network itself, in all of its complexity. The network is only the latest, but certainly the most advanced, civilisation-scale tool fo introspection our species has built so far (249).

As I'm convinced by the convenience of technology in everyday life, I notice myself being less sensitive about "sharing" my privacy to platforms of all kinds. The concept of "convenience" almost blinds me from being aware of any potential harm/consequence it may arise from data sharing. We should acknowledge (or be acknowledged) how our own data is being "traded" in the market to wisely decide what information should remain private whereas what is ok to leave on public platforms.
